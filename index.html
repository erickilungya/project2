        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My passion for photography is an ever-burning flame that ignites my soul.
            <br> It's more than just a hobby; it's a way of seeing the world, of freezing fleeting moments in time.
            <br>  The inspiration behind my journey into photography emerged from the realization that life's most beautiful and profound moments are often ephemeral.
            <br> Through the lens, I discovered a way to hold onto these fragments of beauty, to create a visual tapestry woven from emotions, colors, and stories.
            <br>  Every click of the shutter is a testament to my desire to encapsulate the world's magic and share it with others, inviting them to see the world through my lens and feel the emotions that pulse within each photograph.

        <p>
            Eric,born in the year 2003 is a gifted photographer whose passion for photography began at a early age after realization that life's most beautiful and profound moments are often ephemeral.
            since my photography journey began, I have seen a million sunsets and I loved it when i see a flock of birds move across the sky and of course, I've captured each on film.
            It is evident that photography work creates a visual impression on something and can be used to explain many aspects of life.

         <p>
             Diane is an American photographer whose favourite subjects were marginalized people, standing on the fringes of society: tattooed men, circus performers, transgender and disabled people were her most iconic models.
             She highlighted the importance of equality at a time when not many people were willing to face the marginalized and recognizw them as functioning parts of society.
